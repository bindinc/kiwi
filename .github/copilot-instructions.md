- Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.
Don't use `Start-Process"` to open index.html, but use playwright mcp instead.
