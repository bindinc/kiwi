- Pure HTML5
- CSS3 (responsive, modern design)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Local storage for demo data
- Debug mode modal (triggered by pressing ']' four times)


## development instructions
- Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.
Don't use `Start-Process"` to open index.html, but use playwright mcp instead.
